#define PORT "30214" /* the port client will be connecting to */

[Final Exam]
All the questions are short answer

Some are tracing through C code

Questions that are much like the quizzes



[Principles]
Mcllroy's Observations PROBABLY ON Exam
I) Make each program do one thing well
II) Output of one program should be ingput of another
III) Test early
IV) Build temporary Programs

Pike's rules
I) Premature optimization is bad
II) Measure to determine necessity of optimization
III) Don't get fancy unneccesarily (usually only good for big N)
IV) Fancy algorithms are buggier
V) Data dominates (data structures are central)

UNIX Big Ideas
I) Modularity
II) Clarity
III) Composition
IV) Separation
V) Simplicity
VI) Parsimony: write a big program only when nothing else will do
VII) Transparency
VIII) Robustness
IX) Representation
X) Least Surprise
XI) Silence
XII) Repair: fail nosily
XIII) Economy: conserve programmer time in machine time
XIV) Generation: write programs to write programs
XV) Optimization: finish before optimization
XVI) Diversity: no "one true way"
