Order of difficulty (expected)

1. A
- pos + neg and bigger 180? 360 -
- 0 and 180 special case

2. Video games 
- maps of name to game

3. Conveyor belt sushi
- rotate the conveyor belt array clockwise
- simulate belt moving every second

4. What time is it Mr. Fox
- too slow to move each sheep for each call
- instead keep track of how many times each hour was called between "lunch time" calls
- when lunch time, distance moved by sheep i can be computed in O(h) time where h = 11 is the number of different possible calls apart from "lunch time"
- Running time O(n * h * c) (c is lunch time calls)

idea: accumulate between lunch times and process all at once

5. Genie
- Exactly W "real wishes"
- There is a dynamic programming

6. Hexadecimal confusion
- To find max replace all 0 by D and all 8 by B, add them
- To find min replace all B by 8 and all D by 0

7. spies vs. spies
- for each row and column that has a point maintain the points in that line in sorted order
- maintain pointers/indices into the sorted list that indicate the prefix / suffixes that have been eliminated
- be careful a point might have been eliminated from a vertical look so skip over them when processing a prefix / suffix of its row
- O(q + nlogn)

8. poetic tournament
- intended solution is O(nlogk)
- maintain solted list, insert binary search
- keep list MAX size of k, don't need the lowers
- C++ nthelement call (used interactor as comparator operator)

9. corporate retreat
- graph G with k <= 7 nodes S such that each v elementof V - S is a neighbour of some node in S, determining if G has a 3-colouring

- brute force al 3^7 possible ways to 3-colour S. For each v elementof V - S, there are at most two possible colours for w since it has a neighbour in search
- Use 2-SAT. For each v, associate true with one remaining colour and false with the other. Add clauses ensuring no edge receives the same colour at both endpoints
- Running time: O(3^k * (n + m))

10. energy usage
- dynamic programming. Let f(n,b) to mean the minimum cost to operate the factory to the end of the n-th hour, and have b energy remaining in the battery.
- We also add a (0,0) plan to every hour, and consider this the 0-th plan. This is equivalent to no plan.
- Base casess f(0, 0) = 0, f(0, B) = infinity if b > 0
- Recursion let Erequired (n,deltaB,m) be the extra energy required to gain delta b battery level while utilizing the m-th plan
- O(N * M * B^2 )

11. draft lottery
- 

12. buying jerseys
- given a bipartite graph, find a color c: (natural numbers) -> {0, 1, 2} such that if uv (element of) E either c(u) != c(v) or c(u) = c(v) = 2. Among all such colorings, minimize (sum)(v element V) c(v).

13. team practice
- compute the number of ways students can switch teams during practice while meeting some constraints
- state can eb A(sA, cA)
